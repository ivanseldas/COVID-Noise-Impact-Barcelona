## Overview

This project analyzes and forecasts noise levels in Barcelona, focusing on two main objectives:

1. **A/B Analysis**:
   - Compare noise levels between 2020 and 2021 to identify significant differences.

2. **Time Series Forecasting**:
   - Predict future noise levels using historical data.
   - Address the impact of COVID-19 on noise trends.

## Objectives

- Predict future noise trends for urban planning.
- Evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on noise levels.
- Compare pre- and post-COVID noise patterns.

## Data Source

This project utilizes data from the **[Noise Monitoring Network](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/xarxasoroll-equipsmonitor-dades)** provided by **[OPEN DATA BCN](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/en/)**, the open data portal of Barcelona City Council. The dataset is publicly available and subject to the licensing terms outlined on their website.

We acknowledge and thank OPEN DATA BCN for making this data available to the public.

## Methodology

1. **Time Series Forecasting**:
   - Models: ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet.
   - Metrics: RMSE, MAPE.

2. **A/B Analysis**:
   - Statistical tests: t-tests, Mann-Whitney U.

## Results [ONGOING]

- **Forecasts**: Predictive insights for future noise levels.
- **COVID Impact**: Quantified noise reduction during restrictions.
- **Yearly Comparison**: Significant changes in noise patterns from 2020 to 2021.

---

## Tools

- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, Prophet).
- **Visualization**: Folium, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Statistical Analysis**: T-tests, Mann-Whitney U.

## Future Work

- Extend analysis to more years.
- Integrate external factors like traffic and weather.
- Build an interactive dashboard for noise monitoring.
