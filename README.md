## Overview

This project analyzes and forecasts noise levels in Barcelona, focusing on two main objectives:

1. **A/B Analysis**:
   - Compare noise levels between 2020 and 2021 to identify significant differences.

2. **Time Series Forecasting**:
   - Predict future noise levels using historical data.
   - Address the impact of COVID-19 on noise trends.

## Objectives

- Predict future noise trends for urban planning.
- Evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on noise levels.
- Compare pre- and post-COVID noise patterns.

---

## Dataset

- **Location**: Noise sensors across Barcelona (see heatmap).
- **Data**: Noise levels (dB), timestamps, and sensor coordinates.
- **Years**: 2020â€“2021.

---

## Methodology

1. **Time Series Forecasting**:
   - Models: ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet.
   - Metrics: RMSE, MAPE.

2. **A/B Analysis**:
   - Statistical tests: t-tests, Mann-Whitney U.
   - Visualizations: Heatmaps and comparative charts.

---

## Results

- **Forecasts**: Predictive insights for future noise levels.
- **COVID Impact**: Quantified noise reduction during restrictions.
- **Yearly Comparison**: Significant changes in noise patterns from 2020 to 2021.

---

## Tools

- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, Prophet).
- **Visualization**: Folium, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Statistical Analysis**: T-tests, Mann-Whitney U.

---

## Future Work

- Extend analysis to more years.
- Integrate external factors like traffic and weather.
- Build an interactive dashboard for noise monitoring.
